            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Research Engineer, Skoltech Huawei Project | May 2022 - Aug 2023 | Moscow, Russia</p>
            <p>Developed a novel and generic approach to answering complex questions for multilingual databases.</p>
            <p>Achieved state of the art results on MINTAKA data set and published work in PACLIC 2023 conference being organised in Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>Data Analyst, Omni Net Technologies | Jan 2019 - April 2021 | Lucknow, India</p>
            <p>Worked in the Data Analysis team using unsupervised clustering algorithms for internet-based services and recommender systems.</p>
            <p>Worked on database management systems for e-commerce websites, particularly on the task of link prediction.</p>
            <p>Research Intern, Beijing Normal University | Oct 2017 - Aug 2018 | Beijing, China</p>
            <p>Studied the variation of various primary and secondary geometric parameters in resulting morphology w.r.t hydro logical and IHA parameters, simulated the unsteady flow in Delft3D.</p>
            <p>Used PCA and SVMs to create feature maps and study the correlation between discharge rates and delta morphology.</p>

            <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
            <p>Transparent Object Segmentation in ORB-SLAM3 Pipeline | March 2023 - July 2023</p>
            <p>Trained a neural network on the Trans10K dataset for transparent object detection, integrated it into ORB-SLAM3, and evaluated performance using absolute trajectory and pose errors.</p>
            <p>Image Restoration using Swin Transformer | Dec 2021 - March 2022</p>
            <p>Replicated SwinIR for image restoration with Gaussian noise, evaluated using PSNR and SSIM. Compared performance on denoising and deblurring tasks and assessed metrics with ISTA and FISTA algorithms.</p>
            <p>Comparing Architectures for Image Captioning on FLICK 8K | Mar 2021 - May 2021</p>
            <p>Compared GRU and Transformer models using ResNet101, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3 backbones for image captioning. Evaluated training speed, inference time, and BLEU scores, finding DenseNet + Transformer as the best performer.</p>
